**Begin with  [Video-1](https://youtu.be/cp2rL3sAFmI),  [Video-2](https://youtu.be/p8TaTgr4uKM)**

First of all, go through with this video link and develop practice code for SQLite Database.

**Tutorial Definition**

As the user opens App, he should be asked for the login. If he is not registered yet, so provide a link for the registration screen. From the registration screen, he can create his user credential (first name, last name, email, gender-radio button, branch-spinner) and submit (Take reference of Tutorial-5).

As the user registered, now he should be asked for the login with his credential which is stored in the database while registration and the welcome screen should display his username.  **You need to add all the fields used in tutorial 05.**

**Hint:**

-   Use SQLiteOpenHelper class for database operation.
