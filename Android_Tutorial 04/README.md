Splash screen, Login Screen and Welcome Screen design In-App Using Android Studio...

In tutorial 03, add one more screen as  **Splash Screen**  for a "Welcome" message with logo/Text. After 2 seconds it should open  **Login Screen.** Also, add email validation in the Login form.

**Hint:**

-   For auto execute any task after some delay or to do some task periodically use  _**[Timer](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Timer)**_  class.
-   To validate any input Regular Expiration (Regex) is the most efficient way. For that android has  _**[Patterns](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Patterns)**_ class
-   To have control of the screen orientation, and other configuration from  _**[here ](https://alvinalexander.com/source-code/android/how-do-i-make-my-android-app-display-landscape-mode-only)**_.
